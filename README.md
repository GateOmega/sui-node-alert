# sui-node-alert
The python script simply checks whether your node is synced with the Sui blockchain and if your node's version is the same as the Sui Testnet &amp; Devnet version. It periodically checks the transaction count on the Sui blockchain and your node, and sends an alert via Telegram if the transaction count on your node is more than a certain threshold that you set.
